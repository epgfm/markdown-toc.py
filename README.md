# markdown-toc.py

A python script to generate a TOC from a Markdown file

## Self-contained

I hate how the actual markdown-toc makes you use f*cking `npm`.
That stuff is always broken and full of dependencies. 

## Specs

Here are the tech specs:

### Pass document as command line argument

### Output to stdout or to file

### Accept input from standard input

### Can be tested using the repo's README.md file.
